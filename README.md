# sftp-downloader
Utility to download files from sftp server. Utility keeps track of downloaded files so files are only downloaded once. 

This application was created to experiment with mongodb, typescript and node js.

Mongodb/typescript is probably overkill for such a utility. Keeping track of downloaded files could be just as easily done via a persisted json file on the filesystem.
